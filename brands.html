		<h2 class="spice">CLASSIC SPICES</h2>
		<p><br>Spices enhance the taste and flavour of food.
			It’s well known that spices elevate the taste and flavour of food. Just a bit of spice can transform everyday ingredients into an appetizing and aromatic meal. Spices contribute rich flavour to food without adding any calories, fat, sugar or salt.
			Herbs and spices also add flavours to dishes which, again, increases their complexity but also complements or plays counterpoint to other flavours already present.For example, ginger and turmeric have anti-inflammatory properties and are widely used in recipes not only for their taste but for these health benefits. Another example is spices like cumin and cinnamon which play a role in digestion and can help with weight management.
			Adding different spices to your meals can certainly help boost your nutrition. If you’re wondering which spices can be considered healthy spices, all of them are! Each with their own set of health benefits.

		<h2 class="spice">SUPA OIL</h2>
		<p>Everytime someone mentions oil or fried foods, we are quick to associate it with obesity and heart ailments. Though the fear is not entirely unjustified, the truth remains that food prepared in oil is tastier and fats from oil are an important part of our daily diet. Thus, it is important to know the why, what and how about cooking oil. Using a high-quality vegetable oil in the kitchen is important for healthy cooking. The label will provide details of the type of oil and the method of production. But what do terms such as "extra virgin", "cold pressed" and "refined" actually mean? How can you recognise a good-quality oil and what types are suitable for different purposes?

In Indian subcontinent, the confections are often generally referred to as Mithai, which is based on the main ingredient khoyaa; the thick hard cream of milk.

		<h2 class="spice">SUPA PASTA</h2>
		<p><br>
			Pasta is made from grain, one of the basic food groups in a healthy diet that also can include vegetables, fruits, fish, and poultry. It’s a good source of energy and can give you fiber, too, if it’s made from whole grain. That can help with stomach problems and may help lower cholesterol. Try some tagliatelle with wild mushrooms and truffle oil.The basic ingredients are simple and cheap: flour, water, salt, and maybe some eggs. Whether you make your own or buy it at the store, pasta is a great way to feed the family without breaking the bank. Try a traditional spaghetti Bolognese -- the meat simmers in milk and then wine.
